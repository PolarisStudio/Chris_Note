## 1. Ubuntu system

- Using VMware Workstation to load Ubuntu system, learning how to use terminal to run program and use git.
## 2. Minimax (and Alpha-Beta) Search

### Description
 Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique for minimax algorithm. It reduces the computation time by a huge factor. This allows us to search much faster and even go into deeper levels in the game tree. It cuts off branches in the game tree which need not be searched because there already exists a better move available.

### Noun Explanation
 - Alpha: is the best value that the maximizer currently can guarantee at that level or above.
 - Beta: the best value that the minimizer currently can guarantee at that level or above.

## 3. Monte Carlo tree search

### Description
A search technique in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is a probabilistic and heuristic driven search algorithm that combines the classic tree search implementations alongside machine learning principles of reinforcement learning.
